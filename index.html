      <TD><h3>Rohit Sharma is undoubtedly the cleanest hitter of a cricket ball you will ever see. Nothing can be as pleasing as the sight of the ‚ÄòHitman‚Äô striking the ball over the covers. Rohit Sharma is the current vice-captain of the Indian Cricket Team in the limited-overs.

        Once hailed as a ‚Äòtalented‚Äô youngster to later ridiculed by the critics for his inconsistency and now becoming an important cog in the Indian batting line up, this Mumbaikar‚Äôs journey is nothing short of a movie right there in the making.Rohit is also the captain of the IPL team Mumbai Indians. Sharma currently holds the record for the highest individual score in One Day Internationals. He scored a record 264 off 173 balls against Srilanka on November 13, 2014. Rohit is also the only player to score two double centuries in One Day Internationals. He is also the only person to score 250+ in ODI innings.</h3></TD>
